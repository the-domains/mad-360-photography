I love photography and art. My family always had a camera around, but no one was really into photography as an art form. My grandfather was an artist, a painter and sculptor. So, I guess art is in my blood.

I was lucky enough to travel widely as a child as a child of a diplomat and ambassador. I got to do, see and visit places that many people dream of saving for and seeing it once they retire. I got to see it as a child.

As an adult I have been lucky enough to travel the world for work, taking pictures as I went. Later, I started taking photos as a fine art photographer.
