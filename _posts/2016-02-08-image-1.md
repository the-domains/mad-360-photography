This is a quick overview of some of the edits I've made on my most recent photoshoots.  On this post I'll show the original image as well as the final retouched image. 

My workflow for editing my images is really rather simple. I first cull the photos in Lightroom so that I have a manageable number of images to work on. Then I do some initial retouching using only lightroom to see what the potential of the images I like from the photoshoot. I then show the client and they usually pick about 20 images they would like to have.

From that point on, I reset the image to its original format and work on it in Photoshop. Within photoshop I use Nik Google Plugins to do some of the color editing etc. My workflow usually works like this for portraits:

Sharpener Pro 3 - Raw presharpener to sharpen the image.

Viveza - to do some color correction

Color Effects Pro - to bring out details and correct contrast. The plugins I like to use the most are detail extractor, pro contrast, and skin smoothener. I usually apply these effect with a paintbrush in order to bring out details only in the areas I wish to emphasize. I usually use the pro contrast plugin globally. The skin smoothener I also apply with a paintbrush to adjust the skin tonality without removing too much detail and leaving plastic skin tones.

I then might use silver effects pro with the luminosity layer. This brings out the details a little and gives a great effect. But it depends on the image. I don't want the final image to look crunchy and over processed.

I use analog effects pro to add a vignette effect if the image looks like it would benefit from it.

I then use define to remove any unwanted noise. 

I then resize the image for the internet within Photoshop. I usually use 72 dpi and have the long edge set to 1024 pixels. Once this is done I use Sharpener Pro 3 - output sharpener to optimize the image for monitors and devices. 

I am then free to post the image on instagram or any other website. If I am going to make a print, I resize the image in photoshop for the correct print size then use Sharpener Pro 3 to sharpen it for the media it will be printed.

I should really create a photoshop action for this since this is what I do for nearly 95% of the portraits I take. I think that the finished product using this workflow is really rather good.

However, there are a few modifications to my workflow. For example if I need to use liquify to adust some areas of the photo (digitally enhance a model), then I will do it before using analog effect pro for example.

In this image I enhanced the color of the background to make it pop more. I originally used a color filter on an off camera speedlight. It was placed behind the models to camera left and aimed at a white wall at the back.

In front of the models I had two speedlights in softboxes. One on camera left and one on camera right to light the models evenly. You can kind of see them on the reflections on the red latex dress of the model.

I used liquify to adjust the waistline of the model in red to give her nicer curves.

I have had to obscure the face of one of the models as she prefers her identity to be held private.

Image two had minimal editing. I enhanced the color a little. I also brought out some detail in the mask and wood grain. I also gave the model in red a little tummy tuck. I also added a little bit of warmth.

The lighting was pretty much the same as on Image 1\. One speedligh with a blue gel on it behind the models to camera left.

Two speedlights, one to camera right and one to camera left in front of the models in softboxes.

I tightened the crop on this photo, adjusted the colors and added some warmth.

The lighting setup for this was a single speedlight inside an octabox on camera left.

I adjusted the colors, reduced her waistline and added a vignette to this image.
